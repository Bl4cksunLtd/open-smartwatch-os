# How to contribute to the Open-smartwatch

When the develop branch is ahead of the master and the develop branch is in the stabilization phase, it periodically merges the develop branch into the master.

In order to contribute new or updated documentation, you must first create a GitHub account and fork the original repository to your own account. You can make changes, save them in your repository, then make a pull request against this repository. The pull request will appear in the repository where it can be assessed by the maintainers, copy edited, and if appropriate, merged with the official repository.

Unless you are opening a pull request which will only make small corrections, for instance to correct a typo, you are more likely to get traction for your changes if you open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes. 

NOTE: If you want to send a pull request, please work based on the develop branch

If you are reading this page, you are possibly interested in contributing to our project. We have a very active (and friendly) developer group and would love to have the help! Possible ways you can help:

* Testing the code
* Filing issues on github, when you see a problem (or adding detail to existing issues that effect you)
* Fixing issues
* Adding new features
* Reviewing existing pull requests, and notifying the maintainer if it passes your code review.
